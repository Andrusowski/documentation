The **Content** section in the Back Office is mostly used by Marketing Content Managers and Marketing Team.
***
The section is designed to create, manage and display content in the storefront. The content is represented by **CMS Pages**, **CMS Blocks**, **Content Items**, **Navigation**, **Slots**, **Redirects**, **File lists**, and **File trees**.


In the **Content** section, you can see the following:

* Content Items
* Blocks
* Pages
* Navigation
* Slots
* Redirects
* File List
* File Tree

**Content Item** is the smallest preserved piece of content that you can insert into CMS blocks and CMS pages. 

**CMS blocks** are parts of the page content that you can can insert into CMS pages.

**CMS pages** are additional pages you can create and manage to provide additional information about the shop like About Us, Terms and Conditions pages, or landing pages for promotions. 

**Redirect** is a technique to forward website visitors from one page to another. You can redirect visitors to internal and external pages.

**Slot** is a configurable space for content in page templates. By inserting CMS blocks into slots, you add content to the Storefront.

**Navigation** is a page element that allows customers to browse the website.

**File list** allows you to manage the files in your shop.

**File tree** allows you to manage the structure of the files in your shop.
