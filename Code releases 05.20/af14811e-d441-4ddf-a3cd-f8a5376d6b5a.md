The **Customers** section in the Back Office is mostly used by Spryker Admins.

This section is used for managing customer and company data from the Back Office. You can  add personal information like name, email address, customer billing and shipping addresses. In most cases, the customer profiles are added by customers in the online store. In the B2B world, customer data is also managed in the online store.

@(Warning)(Important)(The customer registration can be completed only by the customer by setting up the password for the account (either by following the link sent by email or by clicking the reset password button in the shop).)
