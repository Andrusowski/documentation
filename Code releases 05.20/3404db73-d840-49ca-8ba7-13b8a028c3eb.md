The **Catalog** section in the Back Office is mostly used by the team members involved in Product Management.
It is used by:
* Product Catalog Manager in **Catalog > Products, Category, Attributes, Availability, Product Options, Product Lists, Product Barcodes, Scheduled Prices** sections in the Back Office.
* Customer Service in the **Catalog > Product Reviews** section in the Back Office.
