After you have created a return for order or a Shop Owner has done it for you, you can print the return slip.

To print the return slip:

1. Go to *My Account > Returns* page.
2. In the Actions column next to the return you want to print the return slip for, click **Print Slip**. This takes you to the print version of the return slip.
