German government [has planned to adjust VAT as a part of the COVID-19 measures](https://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/coronakrise-konjunkturpaket-mehrwertsteuer-101.html). The VAT update could become a nightmare for E-Commerce engineers and Web Developers. However, Spryker provides out-of-the-box mechanisms to support tax adjustments in runtime without migrating prices stored in the Spryker OS.

:::(Warning) (Project tax customizations)
Make sure that custom code follows the Spryker architecture and leveraging Tax calculation plugins. Otherwise, careful revision of the project solutions is required and should be taken into consideration during the project planning.
:::

To get you ready for the tax update on 01.07.2020, we have prepared an example of the solution that will work on our non-modified Demo Shop and should be adjusted accordingly for every project.

Let's assume that:
- you use the default cronjobs configuration from `config/Zed/cronjobs/jenkins.php`;
- you use the default tax import;
- you want to update the tax rate Germany Standard to 16% on 01.07.2020;
- you want to update the tax rate Germany Reduced to 5% on 01.07.2020;
- you want to revert these changes on 01.01.2021.

Please do the following:
1. Create the `data/import/reduce_tax.csv` file with the following content:
```
tax_set_name,country_name,tax_rate_name,tax_rate_percent
Standard Taxes,Germany,Germany Standard,16
Reduced Taxes,Germany,Germany Reduced,5
```
2. Create the `data/import/restore_tax.csv`file with the following content:
```
tax_set_name,country_name,tax_rate_name,tax_rate_percent
Standard Taxes,Germany,Germany Standard,19
Reduced Taxes,Germany,Germany Reduced,7
```
3. Update `config/Zed/cronjobs/jenkins.php` by adding two more jobs:
```PHP
/* Reduce tax rate */
$jobs[] = [
    'name' => 'reduce-tax-rate',
    'command' => '$PHP_BIN vendor/bin/console  data:import:tax -f data/import/reduce_tax.csv',
    'schedule' => '0 0 1 7 *',
    'enable' => true,
    'stores' => $allStores,
];
/* Restore tax rate */
$jobs[] = [
    'name' => 'restore-tax-rate',
    'command' => '$PHP_BIN vendor/bin/console  data:import:tax -f data/import/restore_tax.csv',
    'schedule' => '0 0 1 1 *',
    'enable' => true,
    'stores' => $allStores,
];
```
:::(Info) (Info)
In July 2020, you have to remove the first job, and in January 2021, the last one.
