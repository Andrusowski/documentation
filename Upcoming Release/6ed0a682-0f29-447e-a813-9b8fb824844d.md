A role includes a set of permissions that can be enabled/disabled according to your needs by switching the toggle in **Enable** column.
  - **Add company users** - allows adding company users. With this permission enabled, a user will have **Create User** button on the **Company Users** page.
  - **Invite users** - allows inviting company users. With this permission enabled, a user will have **Invite Users** button on the **Company Users** page.
  - **Enable / Disable company users** - allows enabling and disabling company users. With this permission enabled, a user will be able to switch a toggle in the **Enable** column on the **Company Users** page.
  - **See Company Menu** - allows access to the company menu. With this permission enabled, a user will be able to navigate to a company menu from the header of the shop interface.

  - **Buy up to grand total (Requires "Send cart for approval")** - sets a limit for the grand total of the cart. If the amount in the cart is bigger than the limit set in this permission, the user will not be able to proceed to checkout. Works with **Send cart for approval** permission. This permission is available after enabling the [Approval Process](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/approval-process-201903) feature.

  - **View Business Unit Orders** - allows searching across the orders of a business unit to which you belong.
