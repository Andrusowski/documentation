For every registered customer, there is an order history retrievable. The list of orders, as well as detailed order information including every step of the calculation and addresses used in the orders, is available for retrieval.

In your development, this resource can help you to:

* Make the order history available to customers
* Make order details available to enable reordering functionality

The **Order History API** allows you to retrieve all orders made by a registered customer.

@(Warning)(Authentication)(Since order history is available for registered users only, the endpoints provided by the API cannot be accessed anonymously. For this reason, you always need to pass a user's authentication token in your REST requests. For details on how to authenticate a user and retrieve the token, see [Authentication and Authorization]().)

## Installation
For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see Order History API.

## Retrieving all Orders
To retrieve a list of all orders made by a registered customer, send the request:

---
`GET` **/orders**

---

### Request
Request sample: 
`GET http://glue.mysprykershop.com/orders`

### Response
The endpoint responds with an array of orders placed by the authenticated customer. In the response, each order will have a unique identifier. It is specified in the **id** attribute. You can use the ID to retrieve detailed order information. Also, **self** links will be provided to access an order. individually using the REST API.

| /orders?offset=10&limit=10 | Returns orders **11** through **20**. |
