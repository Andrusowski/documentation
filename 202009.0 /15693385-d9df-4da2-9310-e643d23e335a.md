Originally, *Silex* was used to integrate Symfony Components with Spryker using _Service Providers_. Also, there are multiple other Service Providers added by Spryker and customer projects to bootstrap the application. Such providers implement *Symfony components* and other entities by adding them to the *Pimple container*. Since Silex project is abandoned and the Pimple version is outdated, we intend to replace them with a Spryker solution.

## What are we replacing?
We are going to replace `silex/silex` and `pimple/pimple`.

To be able to replace Silex, we need to remove all the  dependencies on the abandoned `silex/silex` project in Spryker version `1.3.6`. The Spryker code will be refactored gradually until it is independent of Silex. 

We added a new Spryker application to replace Silex and a container to repalce Pimple.

## Is Silex replacement backward compatible?
To avoid forcing an immediate update of a majority of modules, we introduced several small changes, which are backward compatible.

As Silex used to be an instance of Pimple with all services attached to, we introduced our own _Container_ that implements the `ContainerInterface` from [PSR-11](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-11/). Additionally, we added a mock class for Pimple that further extends the Container. The mock class allows us to keep using the `\Pimple;` `USE` statement without the `pimple/pimple` package. In this case, we don't have to refactor the code that has Pimple dependencies and all the changes are backward compatible.

:::(Warning) ()
We moved the dependency to `spryker/silex` to `require-dev` in all Spryker modules.
 When you update a module partially, you might have to add `spryker/silex` to your root `composer.json`. 
:::

## What will change?

This section describes the changes caused by the Silex migration.


### Application plugins

Since `ServiceProviderInterface` is not provided anymore, any code that implements it has to be migrated to the new model. 

To provide a proper replacement for each Service Provider, we introduce *Application plugins*. An Application plugin is a plugin that integrates a service like Twig, Form, Security, or Routing into the application. Each plugin is added to the corresponding `ApplicationDependencyProvider`.

:::(Warning) ()
If you use `ServiceProviderInterface`, make sure to include `spryker/silex` as a `require` dependecy on the project level.
:::

### Service extension

Silex allowed extending or overwriting existing services. Now, instead of adding multiple Service Providers, you can use extension points for the services. If a service like Twig is added as an Application plugin, it has its own extension interface.

### Existing service providers

Existing Service Providers remain unchanged. New services are added as Application plugins. The application plugins have extension points to add or change the functionality.

## What do you need to update?

You need to update several modules and other packages. The main modules that should be updated are `spryker/silex`, `spryker/application`, and `spryker/container`. However, we recommend updating all the outdated modules. The minimum versions that allow migrating from Silex and Pimple are as follows:
*   `spryker/application` >= `3.13.2`
*   `spryker/container` >= `1.1.0`
*   `spryker/silex` >= `2.1.0`
*   `spryker/symfony` >= `3.2.2`
*   `spryker-shop/shop-application` >= `1.4.1`
:::(Info) ()
The versions above are the minimum requirements. We recommend updating all the modules to the latest versions.
:::

In some older Spryker Commerce OS or Spryker Demoshop versions, there can be dependencies in the `composer.json`. If your project is based on such a version, make sure that the mentioned modules do not appear as project dependencies and that there are no constraint points to `silex/silex`, `spryker/pimple`, or `pimple/pimple`.
:::(Info) ()
Under certain circumstances, an update does not contain the latest versions of the required Spryker modules. To find out why they are not installed, you can use the `why` and `why-not` Composer commands. They will help you to update the dependencies.
:::
### Specific services
We refactored the modules below to use Application plugins. There are additional steps required to migrate the modules to the latest version.

## How to extend or change services?
To extend a service, use the extension interface of the respective service. For example, The `Twig` module contains `TwigApplicationPlugin`. The `TwigExtension` module brings at least one interface that can be used to extend Twig. To extend it, add `TwigApplicationPlugin` to `ApplicationDependencyProvider`. To extend Twig further, add a plugin to `TwigDependencyProvider`.

You can still extend serviceÑ‹ via Service providers. 

## Removing Silex completely

To remove Silex:

1. Update the modules from [Make Silex optional](https://api.release.spryker.com/release-group/2589).
2. In `public/Glue/index.php` replace `Pyz\Glue\GlueApplication\Bootstrap\GlueBootstrap` with `Spryker\Glue\GlueApplication\Bootstrap\GlueBootstrap`. 
3. Add `Spryker\Shared\Http\Plugin\EventDispatcher\ResponseListenerEventDispatcherPlugin` to `\Pyz\Glue\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcherDependencyProvider::getEventDispatcherPlugins()`.
4. Add `Spryker\Glue\Http\Plugin\Application\HttpApplicationPlugin` to `\Pyz\Glue\GlueApplication\GlueApplicationDependencyProvider::getApplicationPlugins()`.
5. Remove the `Pimple` plugin everywhere. To access an [Application](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/application-201903) service, use `$container->getApplicationService('service id');` in the `DependencyProvider`. Then, you can retrieve it within the modules Factory with `$this->getProvidedDependency()`.

6. Add `Spryker\Shared\Http\Plugin\EventDispatcher\ResponseListenerEventDispatcherPlugin` to `\Pyz\Yves\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcherDependencyProvider::getEventDispatcherPlugins()`.

7. Replace each `ServiceProvider` with the annotated replacement of the `ApplicationPlugins` defined in `\Pyz\Yves\Console\ConsoleDependencyProvider::getServiceProviders()` and add the `ApplicationPlugins` to `\Pyz\Yves\Console\ConsoleDependencyProvider::getApplicationPlugins()`.

8. Replace each `ServiceProvider` with the annotated replacement of the `ApplicationPlugins` defined in `\Pyz\Yves\ShopApplication\YvesBootstrap::getServiceProviders()` and add the `ApplicationPlugins` to `\Pyz\Yves\ShopApplication\ShopApplicationDependencyProvider::getApplicationPlugins()`.
