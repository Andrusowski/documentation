The Discount API enables shop owners to add free value to their customers by discounting a percentage or a fixed sum of an order's subtotal or an item's price. Discounts can be applied to a purchase in 2 ways:

1. Discounts applied to carts based on certain conditions, called [cart rules](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/creating-a-cart-rule-discount);
2. Price reductions provided when redeeming a [discount voucher](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/creating-a-discount-voucher).

Discounts provided based on *cart rules* are calculated and taken into account automatically. *Vouchers*, on the other hand, need to be applied customers explicitly. For this purpose, the *Discounts API* allows:

* applying a voucher to a certain purchase contained in a specific cart;
* retrieving the discounted amount of the purchase;
* checking which vouchers and cart rules are applied to a certain purchase;
* removing a voucher from a cart.

In your development, the API will help you to enable customers to apply voucher discounts to their purchases and check the correct order amount, discount included.

## Installation
For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see [GLUE: Promotions & Discounts Feature Integration](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/glue-promotions-discounts-feature-integration).
