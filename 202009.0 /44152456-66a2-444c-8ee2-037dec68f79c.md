[Ratings and reviews](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/rating-reviews) allow customers to share their opinions and experiences about purchases. This enables customers to take meaningful decisions about purchases and increases their trust with the shop.

Glue REST API allows retrieving a list of ratings and reviews for each product, as well as its average rating. This can help frontend developers in building the product page, extending it with the ratings and reviews relevant to each product. 

<!-- Also, the average rating of each product, as well as the number of times it has been reviewed, will be available in all endpoints where abstract and concrete products can be included as a relationship, such as, for example, [/catalog-search](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/catalog-search), [/related-products](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/retrieving-related-products-201903#getting-related-items-for-an-abstract-product), [/up-selling-products](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/retrieving-related-products-201903#getting-up-selling-products-for-a-registered-user-s-cart), [/abstract-alternative-products](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/retrieving-alternative-products-201903), etc. -->

Apart from that, the API allows developers to add the possibility for customers to post ratings and reviews.

In this article, you will learn how to perform the following tasks using REST APIs:

* Retrieve the average rating of any product.
* Retrieve a list of ratings and reviews for a product.
* Allow customers to review and rate products.

## Getting average product rating
The average rating for any product, abstract or concrete, is returned as a part of the request for product information:

* **abstract** products
Endpoint: */abstract-products/{{product_sku}}*
Sample request: `GET http://glue.mysprykershop.com/abstract-products/035`

* **concrete** products
Endpoint: */concrete-products/{{product_sku}}*

Sample request: `GET http://glue.mysprykershop.com/concrete-products/035_17360369`

where **035** and **035_17360369** are the SKUs of the products you want to retrieve average ratings for.

### Response
The endpoints return information on the requested products. The average rating is exposed in the `averageRating` attribute, and the number of times a product was reviewed is returned in the `reviewCount` attribute.

@(Warning)(Note)(If the product hasn’t been reviewed yet, the `reviewCount` attribute is **null**.)

**Sample Response**

    "data": {
        "type": "abstract-products",
        "id": "035",

## Rating and reviewing products
To post a rating and review of a product, send a POST request to the following endpoint:

*/abstract-products/{{product_sku}}/product-reviews*

@(Info)(Info)(Ratings and reviews can be posted for **abstract** products only.)

### Request
The request should contain the rating a customer assigned to the product and their respective review. A review consists of a short summary, which is required, and a more detailed description, which is optional.

Sample request: `POST http://glue.mysprykershop.com/abstract-products/139/product-reviews`

where **139** is the SKU of the **abstract** product a customer wants to rate and/or review.

@(Warning)(Authentication)(Ratings and reviews cannot be posted anonymously. For this reason, you always need to pass a user's authentication token when accessing the endpoint. For details on how to authenticate a user and retrieve the token, see [Authentication and Authorization](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/authentication-and-authorization).)

**Request attributes:**

| Attribute | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **nickname** | String | yes | Specifies the customer’s nickname.</br>This nickname should be displayed each time the review is shown. The customer’s actual username used for authentication can therefore be hidden. |
| **rating** | Integer | yes | Specifies the rating given to the product by the customer. |
| **summary** | String | yes | Specifies the review summary. |
| **description** | String | no | Specifies the full text of a review. |

        }
    }
}
