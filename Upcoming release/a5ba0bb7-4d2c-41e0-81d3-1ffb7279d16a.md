A brute-force login attack is considered one of the most famous hacker attacks conducted to get access to web applications. If the application does not provide due security measures—allows setting weak passwords, does not lock out multiple unsuccessful login attempts—the authentication system becomes vulnerable, which may result in disastrous consequences for the business.

The *Storefront Login* feature allows you to prevent malicious logins and enforces password security. The feature enables you to restrict the possibility for the Storefront users to register with simple passwords and locks out accounts after several unsuccessful logins for a certain period of time. This way, you can use the Storefront Login feature to increase the Storefront account security and minimize the risk of being exposed to password-guessing attacks.
