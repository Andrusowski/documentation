Give your Back Office users the freedom of choosing their way of authentication to the Back Office.

The Spryker Back Office supports two types of authentication:

* Regular authentication with the Back Office user email and password
* Third-party sign-on

Thus, besides the standard login with the username and password, you can enable authentication via a third party, so your customers do not have to enter any login details. It improves user experience, as they don’t have to create and remember the password and can easily log in with a couple of clicks.

After a user authenticates to the Back Office with a third party, you can create a Back Office account based on the information from the user’s third-party profile.. Alternatively, you can allow logins from the third-party services only after you created and activated the user with the email they use for login from the third-party service.
