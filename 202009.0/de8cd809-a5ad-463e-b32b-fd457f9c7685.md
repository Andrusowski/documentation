The following document covers the APIs for carts for **registered customers**. 

@(Info)(Info)( If you want to know how to access carts of unregistered users, see [Managing Guest Carts](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/managing-guest-carts).)

## Multiple Carts

Unlike guest carts, carts of registered users have an unlimited lifetime. Also, if the Multiple Carts feature is [integrated into your project](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/multiple-carts-feature-integration-201903), and Glue is [enabled for multi-cart operations](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/multiple-carts-feature-integration-201903), registered users can have an unlimited number of carts.

## Owned and Shared Carts
Registered users can [share carts](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/shared-cart) they own. Thus, a registered user can access both their personal carts and carts shared with them by other users. This feature allows company users to collaborate on company purchases as a team.
To be able to share carts, as well as access carts shared with them, customers need to authenticate as [Company User Accounts](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/retrieving-company-user-information-201907). Each such account is a member of a certain Business Unit, and carts can be shared only among members of the same Unit. On the other hand, customers have the ability to impersonate as different Company Accounts depending on the job tasks they want to perform. Such accounts can belong to different Business Units, which means that any specific customer can have access to a different set of shared carts depending on the Company Account they impersonate as.

To use a Company Account, a customer needs to retrieve a bearer token for the account. The token is valid for a specific combination of an authenticated user and Company Account. It provides access to:
*  carts owned by the user
*  carts shared with the Company Account.

@(Info)(Authentication)(For details on how to receive the token, see [Logging In as Company User](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/logging-in-as-company-user-201907){target="_blank"}.)

To be able to access shared carts, the API client needs to access the endpoints provided by the Carts API using the token received when impersonating as the Company Account. Doing so provides access to management of both the user's own carts and the carts shared with the current Company Account based on the bearer token presented.

Shared carts can be accessed and manipulated the same as regular carts. The only difference is that the list of actions that a user can perform on a shared cart depends on the permissions granted to them.

By default, there are 2 levels of permissions for shared carts: **read-only** and **full access**. If a user attempts to perform an unauthorized action on a shared cart, the API will respond with the **403 Forbidden** status code.

@(Info)(Info)(For more details, see [Retrieving Cart Permission Groups](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/sharing-company-user-carts-201907#retrieving-cart-permission-groups))

To distinguish whether a specific cart is owned by a user directly or shared with them, you need to extend the responses of the endpoints with the **cart-permission-groups** resource relationship.. If a cart is shared with the user, it will contain the relationship, while if a cart is owned by the user directly, the relationship will not be present.


@(Info)(Info)(For more details, see section *Retrieving Cart Permission Groups* in [Sharing Company User Carts](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/sharing-company-user-carts-201907){target="_blank"}.)
