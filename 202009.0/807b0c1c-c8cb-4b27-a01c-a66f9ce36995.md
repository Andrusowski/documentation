Spryker uses modular programming and packaging principles for organizing every functionality into independent software packages, aka modules. 
To establish a common infrastructure across all modules and to assist configurability, flexibility, agility, and modularity, the modules are divided into application layers according to the Spryker OS application design concept. Each application layer is further divided into layers following the layered architecture pattern.

This article describes the Spryker layers and their roles in the application layers.

## Layers

Layers are not limited to any specific application layer, yet in practice, there is a specific set of layers utilized by each application layer.

The Spryker layer structure is as follows:

Each layer is responsible for handling one main purpose inside the application layer.

1. **Persistence Layer** 
This layer is responsible for defining and dealing with the database in a module. The database table schemas and query objects are defined in this layer. The Persistence Layer cannot access any other layer above it.

2. **Business Layer** 
This layer is where all the business logic is implemented. It usually has several business models to serve the necessary functionality. The Business Layer is located directly above the Persistence Layer, so it can access it for the read/write operations.

3. **Communication Layer** 
This layer is an entry point of a module. When a front-end application communicates with the Commerce OS, the Communication Layer is accessed first. Then, the Communication Layer directs the request depending on the requested functionality.
The Communication Layer is located directly above the Business Layer, so it can access all the business logic in a module. This is needed for the Communication layer to invoke the right business logic when requested.

4. **Presentation Layer** 
This layer is where the view related content is implemented. The Presentation Layer sends requests to the Communication Layer in order to get the needed data. Then it shows the data using the templates.
