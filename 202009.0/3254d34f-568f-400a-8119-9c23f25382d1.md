Checkout allows purchasing the items added to the cart.

@(Info)()(If you have several shopping carts in your account, choose the right one and proceed with the checkout. See [Shop Guide - Shopping Carts](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/shop-guide-shopping-carts) for more information.)

A typical checkout process includes the following steps:

* [Login](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/shop-guide-login-step): you see this step only if you are not logged in to shop. Here you choose how you proceed with the checkout: you either register, log in, or proceed as a guest. 
* [Address](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/address-step-shop-guide-201911): define one or several delivery addresses and add a billing address.
* [Shipment](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/shipment-step-shop-guide-201911): select a shipment method and/or a delivery date.
* [Payment](https://documentation.spryker.com/v3/docs/payment-step-shop-guide-201911): select the payment method.
* [Summary](https://documentation.spryker.com/v3/docs/summary-step-shop-guide-201911): view the details, update the information, if needed, and place the order.
