[Product labels](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/product-label-feature-overview#product-label) are used to draw your customers' attention to some specific products. Each of them has a name, a priority, and a validity period. The Product Labels API provides endpoints for getting labels via the REST HTTP requests.

## Installation
For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see [Glue API: Product Labels Feature Integration](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/glue-api-product-labels-feature-integration).

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name | String | Specifies the label name. |
| isExclusive | Boolean | Indicates whether the label is `exclusive`.</br>If the attribute is set to true, the current label takes precedence over other labels the product might have. This means that only the current label should be displayed for the product, and all other possible labels should be hidden. |
| position | Integer | Indicates the label priority.</br>Labels should be indicated on the frontend according to their priority, from the highest (**1**) to the lowest, unless a product has a label with the `isExclusive` attribute set.|
| frontEndReference | String |Specifies the label custom label type (CSS class).</br>If the attribute is an empty string, the label should be displayed using the default CSS style. |




## Get Product Labels for Cart Items
To retrieve labels for all products in a cart, send a GET request to the following endpoints and include **product-labels** as a relationship:

| Cart Type | Endpoints* | Sample Request | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Registered Customer Cart** | */carts/?include=items,concrete-products,product-labels* | `GET /carts?include=items,concrete-products,product-labels` | Gets labels for all products in all carts of a customer. | To fetch carts of registered customers, you need to authenticate the customers and pass the authentication token as part of your request. For details, see [Managing Carts of Registered Users](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/managing-carts-of-registered-users). |
| **Registered Customer Cart** | */carts/**{{cart_ID}}**?include=items,concrete-products,product-labels* | `GET /carts/369541fa2e-02c2-5d47-b397-8ac1f5c58ff9?include=items,concrete-products,product-labels` | Gets labels for all products in a specific cart. | To fetch carts of registered customers, you need to authenticate the customers and pass the authentication token as part of your request. For details, see [Managing Carts of Registered Users](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/managing-carts-of-registered-users). |
| **Registered Customer Cart** | */carts/**{{cart_ID}}/up-selling-products**?include=items,concrete-products,product-labels* | `GET /carts/369541fa2e-02c2-5d47-b397-8ac1f5c58ff9/up-selling-products?include=items,concrete-products,product-labels` | Gets product labels for all **up-selling products** of a specific cart. | To fetch carts of registered customers, you need to authenticate the customers and pass the authentication token as part of your request. For details, see [Managing Carts of Registered Users](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/managing-carts-of-registered-users). |


@(Warning)(Performance)(The above requests fetch not only label information, but also information on the products in the cart. That can adversely affect the overall performance. Use them with caution and apply caching, where possible.)


## Get Product Labels for Wishlist Items
To retrieve labels for all products in a wishlist, send a GET request to the following endpoints and include **product-labels** as a relationship:

* */wishlists?include=wishlist-items,concrete-products,product-labels* - **all** wishlists of a customer;
* */wishlists/**{{wishlist_ID}}**?include=wishlist-items,concrete-products,product-labels* - specific wishlist.

Sample request: `GET http://glue.mysprykershop.com/wishlists/19154981-f490-56b5-9537-359703a2ed08?include=wishlist-items,concrete-products,product-labels`

where **19154981-f490-56b5-9537-359703a2ed08** is the ID of the wishlist you need labels for.

@(Warning)(Performance)(The above requests fetch not only label information, but also information on the products in the wishlist. That can adversely affect the overall performance. Use them with caution and apply caching, where possible.)

### Response
The endpoint responds with information on the requested wishlist, including the products in it and the labels assigned to them. For each assigned label, the attributes are the same as when requesting that specific label.
