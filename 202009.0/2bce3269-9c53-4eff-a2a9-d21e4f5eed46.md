In the B2B context, buyers usually represent a company and act on its behalf. For this reason, Spryker Commerce OS provides the [Company Account](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/company-account-overview) capability which allows companies to create multiple [Company Users](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/company-account-general-organizational-structure), as well as organize them in Business Units. Customers can impersonate different Company Accounts depending on the task they need to perform.

To impersonate a customer as a Company User, API clients can use the Business on Behalf API. It provides REST access to retrieve a list of the Company Users available to the currently logged in user and impersonate as any user available to them.



During the impersonation process, customers receive an Access Token. The token can be used to access any B2B REST API resources, such as Companies, Business Units, Carts etc. Also, authenticated company users will benefit from the [merchant-specific prices](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/price-per-merchant-relation-feature-overview) available to them (applied to certain business units as a rule) instead of the default ones. Also, you can customize the behavior of your API client to match the user's company, job role, business unit, and scope.

@(Info)()(If the [Prices per Merchant Relation \(Customer specific prices\)](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/price-per-merchant-relation) feature is enabled in your project, all prices returned by Spryker REST API are the prices specific to the Company of the current Company User (if any).)

The same as with B2C resource access tokens, the tokens provided by the API have limited timeframe. When receiving an access token, the response body contains not only the access token itself, but also its lifetime, in seconds, and a **Refresh Token**. When the lifetime expires, the Refresh Token can be exchanged for a new Access Token. The new token will also have a limited lifetime and have a corresponding Refresh Token for future authentication. The default lifetime of the tokens is 8 hours (28800 seconds) for an access token and 1 month (2628000 seconds) for a refresh token. The settings can be changed in the module configuration.

@(Info)(Info)(For details, see [Authentication and Authorization](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/authentication-and-authorization).)

In your development, the endpoint can help you to:

* Authenticate users as B2B Company Users;
* Obtain a token that can be used when accessing protected B2B resources;
* Provide customized user experience based on the user's Company, Business Unit, Role etc;
* Allow users to benefit from prices specific to their company.

## Installation
For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see [Glue API: Company Account Feature Integration](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/company-account-api-feature-integration-201907#glue-api--company-account-feature-integration).
