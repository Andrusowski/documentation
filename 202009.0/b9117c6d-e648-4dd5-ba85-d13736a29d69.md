The Invoice Generation feature allows you to generate invoices and automatically send them to a customer as soon as they placed an order. At the same time, you can also keep the invoices for your records by sending a hidden copy of the invoice to your own email address.

Since the invoice is one of the most common accounting documents, it is a must-have for some customers, as the invoice is:

* An account of money customers pay you.
* Used to settle disputes or legal issues.
* Essential for financial reports and keeping the books.

Due to this, providing your customers with an invoice is not just a nice feature, but sometimes a pre-condition for acquiring new and keeping existing customers.
