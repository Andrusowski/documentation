This endpoint allows to retrieve general information about concrete products.

## Installation
For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see:
* [Glue API: Products Feature Integration](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/glue-api-products-feature-integration).
* [Glue API: Measurement Units Feature Integration](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/glue-api-measurement-units-feature-integration).


## Retrieve a concrete product 
To retrieve general information about a concrete product, send the request:

---
`GET` **/concrete-products/*{{concrete_product_sku}}***

---

| Path parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ***{{concreteproductsku}}*** | SKU of a concrete product to get information for. |

### Request 

| String parameter | Description | Exemplary values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| include | Adds resource relationships to the request. | concrete-product-prices, product-measurement-units, sales-units, product-labels |
| fields | 	Filters out the fields to be retrieved.  | name, image, description |
:::(Warning) (Performance)
* For performance and bandwidth usage optimization, we recommend filtering out only the needed information using the `fields` string parameter.

* If you include more resources, you can still use the `fields` string parameter to return only the needed fields. For example, `GET http://glue.mysprykershop.com/concrete-products/fish-1-1?include=sales-units&fields[concrete-products]=name,description&fields[sales-units]=conversion,precision`.
