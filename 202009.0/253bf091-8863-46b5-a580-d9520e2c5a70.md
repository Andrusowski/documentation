The Product Set feature is supported by 3 modules:

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ProductSet | Manages the Product Setâ€™s core functionalities such as persisting all related data to database and reading from it. It also provides Client functionality to list Product Sets from Search. |
| ProductSetCollector|Provides full Collector logic to export Product Sets to Search and Storage. |
| ProductSetGui | Provides a Zed UI to manage (create, list, update, delete and reorder) Product Sets. |

The `ProductSet` module provides a `spy_product_set` table that stores some non-localized data about Product Set entities. Localized data is stored in the `spy_product_set_data` table. These tables, along with their related URLs and Product Image Sets, contain all necessary data about Product Set entities that you can list in Yves or show their representing Detail Pages.

The products that Product Sets represent are stored in the `spy_product_abstract_set` table along with their sorting position.
