**Tips & Tricks**

* Product options are not considered when adding products from the Catalog page. If you want to select specific options, then click on the product, and [add it to cart from the *Product Details* page](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/shop-guide-managing-products#adding-a-product-to-cart). 
* If product has [measurement](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/measurement-units) or [packaging units](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/packaging-units-202001), it can not be added to Cart from the Category page. You can order such products from the Product Details page.

**Whatâ€™s next?**
Once you have the product in your cart, proceed to [checkout](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/checkout-shop-guide-201911).
