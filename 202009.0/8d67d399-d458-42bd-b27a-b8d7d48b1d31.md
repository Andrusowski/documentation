## Description

When a project still uses Silex, but modules were updated to the newest versions, where Silex is moved to the require-dev dependency, class `Silex/ControllerProviderInterface` is not found.

## Solution
To solve the issue, include direct dependency to Silex on the project level. Also, see [Silex replacement](https://documentation.spryker.com/v6/docs/silex-replacement).
