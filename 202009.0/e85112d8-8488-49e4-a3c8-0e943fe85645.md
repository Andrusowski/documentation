By means of the category API, you are able to retrieve the exact structure of your category tree with its hierarchical characteristics. The category nodes, which describe the tree structure, as well as the categories themselves can be retrieved.

In your development, these resources can help you to:

* Retrieve a category tree for your catalog
* Retrieve —Åategory specific information
* Find out which categories a product belongs to

## Installation
For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see [Category API Feature Integration](https://documentation.spryker.com/v2/docs/category-api-feature-integration-201903).

## Retrieve a category tree

To retrieve the full category tree, containing all available nodes and their children, send the request:

---
`GET` **/category-trees**

---

### Request
