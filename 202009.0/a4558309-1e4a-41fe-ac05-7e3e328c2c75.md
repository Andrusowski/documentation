You can create an account with an online store in two ways: 

* by clicking **Sign Up** in *My Account*;
* by choosing the **Proceed as a registered user (sign up)** option at the [Login step of the checkout](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/shop-guide-login-step).

Regardless of which way you choose, you are taken to the *Sign Up* page.

To create an account:

1. On the *Sign Up* page, fill in all the required fields and click **Sign Up**. You should see a message saying that an email to validate your email address has been sent to you.

2. Check your email. You should have an email from the Spryker Shop.

3. In the email, click **Validate your email address**. This takes you to the *Login* page, which says that your email address has been validated.

4. Log in with the email and password provided during the registration. This takes you to the *Customer Account* page.

If you came to the registration page from the Login checkout step, the cart you created before the registration is converted to the registered userâ€™s cart and appears on the list of your shopping carts. You can now proceed with the checkout as a registered user.
