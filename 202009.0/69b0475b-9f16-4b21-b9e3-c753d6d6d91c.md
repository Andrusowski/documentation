Buyers can add simple products with one product variant to cart directly from the Category page by clicking the **Add to cart** icon on the product card.

For the **Add to cart** icon to be active for the product on the Catalog page, the following criteria should be met: 

* The product should be abstract with only one variant.
* The product should be available.
* The product should not have [attributes](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/attributes).
* The product should not have [measurement](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/measurement-units) or [packaging units](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/packaging-units-202001).

Product belonging to a [product group](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/product-abstraction) can also be added to cart from the Category page. However, like with regular products, a product from the product group should have no more than one variant, and be available. 

If a product has [options](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/product-options-2), it can be added to cart from the Category page, but it will be added without any options.
