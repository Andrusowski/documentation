Managing products via Glue API involves multiple resources. These resources follow the hierarchical product structure of Spryker Commerce OS. 

In your development, these resources can help you to retrieve relevant information for your product listing and detail pages, for search, shopping cart, checkout, order history, wishlist and many more.

## Installation
For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see:
* [Glue API: Products Feature Integration](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/glue-api-products-feature-integration).
* [Glue API: Measurement Units Feature Integration](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/glue-api-measurement-units-feature-integration).

## Abstract and concrete products
As Spryker Commerce OS implements product data in a hierarchical structure, this concept is also implemented in the Product API. The API provides separate endpoints for abstract and concrete products. Their names contain the abstract and concrete words, respectively.
