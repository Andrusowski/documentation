To define a period within which an item can be returned, redefine the Config in `Pyz\Zed\SalesReturn\SalesReturnConfig` by adding the following there:

`protected const GLOBAL_RETURNABLE_NUMBER_OF_DAYS = {{Number of days}};`

where *{{Number of days}}* is the time period in days after the item purchase, within which the item can be returned.

Example:
```php
namespace Pyz\Zed\SalesReturn;use Spryker\Zed\SalesReturn\SalesReturnConfig as SprykerSalesReturnConfig;class SalesReturnConfig extends SprykerSalesReturnConfig
{
    protected const GLOBAL_RETURNABLE_NUMBER_OF_DAYS = 30;
}
```
