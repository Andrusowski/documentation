Spryker provides the [Company Account](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/company-account-overview) feature that allows purchasing goods and performing other actions on behalf of a user's company. The endpoints provided by the Company API allow retrieving information on companies.

In your development, the API can help you to provide information on the company that the authenticated user belongs to.

## Installation
