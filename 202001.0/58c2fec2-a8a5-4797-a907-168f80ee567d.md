**Reduce the dropout rate with a smooth checkout workflow.**
*** 
        
The Checkout workflow is a multi-step process that can be fully customized to fit your needs.

The standard steps include customer registration and login, shipping and billing address, shipment method and costs, payment method, checkout overview, and checkout success. You can add, delete, and configure any step of the process the way you need.

You can easily design the process to accommodate different checkout types and to adapt to different preferences, such as one-page checkout or an invoice page replacing the payment page, by means of our step-engine.
        
 With the Checkout functionality, you can enable customers to select single or multiple products and add wishlist items to their cart, as well as integrate different carriers and delivery methods.
