This page describes how you can convert an existing non-docker based project into a docker based one. If you want to install Spryker Commerce OS inÂ Docker from scratch, start from [Getting Started with Docker](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/getting-started-with-docker).

## Prerequisites

To start Docker integration into your project, overview and install the necessary features:

| Name | Feature | Required sub-feature |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Spryker Core | 202001.0 | [Feature](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/spryker-core-feature-integration-201907) |

## Set up .dockerignore

Create a new [`.dockerignore`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file)file to match the project file structure.
```yaml
.git
.idea
node_modules
/vendor
/data
!/data/import
.git*
.unison*
/.nvmrc
/.scrutinizer.yml
/.travis.yml
/newrelic.ini

/docker
!/docker/deployment/
```

## Set up Configuration

Under `config/Shared`, adjust or create a configuration file which depends on the environment name.

As the Docker configuration file is too big, find a ready-made working example in [config_default-docker.php](https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2c-demo-shop/blob/master/config/Shared/config_default-docker.php). Also, the configuration has to be adjusted for specific store(s), e.g [`config_default-docker_DE.php`](https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2c-demo-shop/blob/master/config/Shared/config_default-docker_DE.php).

## Set up Deploy File

[Deploy file](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/deploy-file-reference-10) is a YAML file defining Spryker infrastructure and services for Spryker tools used to deploy Spryker applications in different environments.

It's possible to create an unlimited amount of deployment files with different configuration settings, e.g `deploy.yml` for demo mode or `deploy.dev.yml` for development mode.

Find B2B/B2C deploy file examples for development and demo environments in the table:

| Development mode | Demo mode |
| --- | --- |
| [B2C Demo Shop deploy file](https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2c-demo-shop/blob/master/deploy.dev.yml) | [B2C Demo Shop deploy file](https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2c-demo-shop/blob/master/deploy.yml) |
| [B2B Demo Shop deploy file](https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2b-demo-shop/blob/master/deploy.dev.yml) | [B2B Demo Shop deploy file](https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2b-demo-shop/blob/master/deploy.yml) |

## Set up Installation Script

Under `config/Shared`, prepare the installation recipe that defines the way Spryker should be installed.

Find  installation recipe examples below:
* [B2B Dmo Shop installation recipe](https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2b-demo-shop/blob/master/deploy.yml)
* [B2C Demo Shop installation recipe](https://github.com/spryker-shop/b2c-demo-shop/blob/master/deploy.yml)

## Start Developing

Follow the instructions in [Docker SDK](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/docker-sdk) to start working with Docker.
