## General Information

Docker images/containers are used in the DEV environment. Find more information in [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/userguide/storagedriver/imagesandcontainers/).

File synchronization is enabled when the `dev` mode is active.

In development mode, file changes on host machine are synced into containers and vice-versa.

When containers are killed, all files remain on the host machine.

## Source code synchronization

The following table describes the approaches and solutions used for each supported operating system:

| OS | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Linux | bind mount |
| MacOS | http://docker-sync.io/ |
| Windows | http://docker-sync.io/ |

Find more information about docker-sync, see the [docker-sync documentation](https://docker-sync.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Database Access

In development mode, you can access your postgres database using the following credentials:

* host - `localhost`
* port - `5432`
* user - `spryker`
* pw - `secret`

All of the credentials can be changed in the [Deploy file](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/deploy-file-reference-10).

## Xdebug Support

Use the `-x` argument with the `sdk run|start|up` command to enable Xdebug.

@(Info)()(The full list of possible arguments can be found in [Getting Started with Docker](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/getting-started-with-docker). More information about Xdebug can be found in [Debugging Setup in Docker](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/debugging-setup-in-docker).)
