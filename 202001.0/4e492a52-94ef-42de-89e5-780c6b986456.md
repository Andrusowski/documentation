A Demo Shop is a showcase that we publish to demonstrate our features in a live implementation. Demo Shops are also a great way to kick-start your own project.

As of the [November 2018 release](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/release-notes-2018-11-0), we offer two types of demo shops:

## B2B Demo Shop

Our new B2B Demo Shop is a showcase that is pre-loaded with a combination of modules and functionalities best suited for B2B commerce. This Demo Shop is our recommended starting point for all standard B2B commerce projects. It comes with the new modern look-and-feel and atomic design approach. New features for the B2B Demo Shop are released every several months.

## Master Suite
Master Suite represents a collection of both B2B and B2C modules. However, unlike B2B and B2C Demo Shops, the code in the [Master Suite project repository](https://github.com/spryker-shop/suite) is released as soon as it is ready.  If you have an implementation that combines B2B and B2C, you can benefit from the full range of SCOS functionality.
