Sometimes after experimenting and changing things it is necessary to purge the entire environment to be able to start from scratch and recover from fatal errors. Following the instructions will cause every docker data (but not docker itself) to be permanently deleted. Use with caution!

#### Instructions
1. Delete project folder with this command
 
```
sudo rm -rf [project folder name]
```
2. Delete all containers, networks, unused images and build cache using this command
```
sudo docker system prune -a
```
3. Delete all docker volumes
```
sudo docker system prune --volumes
```
Now everything related to your project should be gone and you can start again with pulling the repros and getting the environment set up.
