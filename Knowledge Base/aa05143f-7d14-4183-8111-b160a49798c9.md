This procedure was suggested for Diva-e who asked for the best practice on this task.

First will be create each `cms_*.csv` (check `data/import` folder) and import them using vendor/bin/console.
```
data:import:cms-block                            This command executes your "cms-block" importer.
data:import:cms-block-category                   This command executes your "cms-block-category" importer.
data:import:cms-block-category-position          This command executes your "cms-block-category-position" importer.
data:import:cms-block-store                      This command executes your "cms-block-store" importer.
data:import:cms-page                             This command executes your "cms-page" importer.
data:import:cms-page-store                       This command executes your "cms-page-store" importer.
data:import:cms-template                         This command executes your "cms-template" importer.
```
Regarding CMS data importers you can check the right order [here](/v22/docs/how-to-work-in-bulks-for-data-import) in our documentation And use a [YAML config file](https://github.com/spryker/suite-nonsplit/blob/master/data/import/common/content_management_import_config_EU.yml), to import cms data.

Using the command `console data:import --config content_management_import_config_EU.yml` and doing the needed adjustments for your project.

:::(Warning)
You can also export the tables on DB with the command `console data:export`

This command executes your exporters (data export). Use the `--config <export_configuration_file.yml>` indicating your configuration YAML file for data export, located in `/data/export/config` folder.
